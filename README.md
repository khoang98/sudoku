BEFORE COMPILE + RUN-- ADD SWI PROLOG TO YOUR MACHINE

PROLOG IS A DOPE LOGIC PROGRAMING LANGUAGE. TO ADD PROLOG-SWI, the bog standard version of Prolog, first download the application at https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable

Then, to use swipl at the command line, add /Applications/SWI-Prolog.app/Contents/MacOS/ to your $PATH variable for MacOS.

for those who forgot: sudo nano /etc/paths is a fast way to do this on newer macs, just use ctrl+x to save and exit the file once you are done. ALSO MAKE SURE TO RESTART YOUR TERMINAL TO MAKE THESE CHANGES TO YOUR PATH TAKE HOLD!!!!

Brew alternatives also exist, but scare me. By default, not downloading prolog is an option as well, it just won't show up in the results. TO UTALIZE PROLOG, uncomment the block in SudokuTester
